The colors of the club changed over time, in the beginning they played in blue and yellow. After a while, they went to their famous color that they have kept for many years, white. They played their first game against their biggest rivals, Barcelona. They played this game on March 13 1902. Below this is a table of Real Madridss biggest achievements from 1902-1950.
