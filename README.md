One part I am proud of in my website is the table I made, it took a while to make but in the end it turned out really nice.
One thing that I had trouble with was how to add all the links of the own pages, I did some research and in the end overcame my problem.
In conclusion, I really liked this project and I would like to do something similar to this again.
